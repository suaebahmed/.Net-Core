# Understanding the ASP.NET Core Web API 8 Project Structure
In .NET 8, the project structure is simpler and more intuitive. Here’s an overview of the main components you’ll encounter:

- Controllers Folder: Contains the controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Models Folder: Defines the data structures used by your API.
- Program.cs: The entry point for the API, where you configure services and the request pipeline (note that in .NET 8, Startup.cs is no longer used).


##### My Learning topics:
- Entity Framework Core
- DbContext		
- Dependency Injection
- Migrations
- DTOs(Data Transfer Objects) and Domain Model
- and etc.
