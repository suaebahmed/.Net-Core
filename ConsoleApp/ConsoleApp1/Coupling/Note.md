# Coupling
In C#, coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules or classes. 
It describes how closely related two modules are.


## Tight Coupling
Tight coupling occurs when classes or modules are highly dependent on each other, 
often directly referencing concrete implementations of other classes.

## Loose Coupling
Loose coupling occurs when classes or modules are designed with minimal dependencies on each other,
typically achieved by depending on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

### This is what designing our code as Loose Coupling gives us;
- Flexibility
- Ease of Maintenance
- Independent Development
- Reusability
- Ease of Testing
- Modularity and Understandability
- Parallel Development
